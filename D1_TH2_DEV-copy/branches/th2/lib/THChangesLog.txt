+	Subver.101: some routines were changed, re-changed and reorganized, which gave me 112 bytes of free space;
+	Banished were quadra immune on Doom Difficulty, now they are resistant to Magic (but still immune to Bone Spirit, as all Undeads);
+	Doom mode Church monsters' resists adjusted so that they won't become impossible for Mages who'd have to fight them with Holy Bolts (this might get fixed in next versions if Holy Bolt gets balanced well);
+	SubRevision #104: made a lot of free space (500+ bytes) by disabling some unused quest code and obsolete Command file code (Command.txt file now will have absolutely no influence on the game);
+	Familiars now are Demons (because Familiars are animal-shaped Demons);
+	Scavenging monsters now gain more life on higher difficulty modes;
+	Scavenging makes a monster go over his maxHP for about 5-10% (this makes higher difficulty gravediggers and ravagers a bit more difficult when found in packs);


	v1.57e

+	Xorene receives activation sound;
+	Purgatory bosses do more damage (+5);
+	1.57_03 > Malantor receives activation sound;
+	1.57_04 > Munmar's Grin: +All Attributes [9-12], Wall of Spears: +All Attributes [5-8];
+	1.57_07 > Higher difficulty monster damage modifiers rewritten for even better balance;
+	1.57_08 > Dungeon palettes in variety - floors [1-16];
+	Koven's 1% mana steal bug fixed, now it works OK;
+	Minor Crypt architecture fixes (SOL);
+	M10 > Flash is given Magic cast animation and sound;
+	Crypt makeup complete;
+	Abyss too, but many palettes are duplicated, more uniques will come with future updates;


	v1.57f

+	Bone Creeper, Doom Archer, Soul Hunter: Hitpoints decrease (~15%);
+	Bile Spitters: HP decrease, ~30%;
+	Extended player entry speeches for Cathedral;
+	Rebalanced +AC% prefix values;
+	Suffix of Aegis now can be found on armors and helms;
+	Uber Diablo's death gives resolution music like in Diablo-2 (that was Fresh Meat's idea, now it found its way to the game);
+	Same with Butcher, but his resolution sound has 2 variations;


	v1.57g

+	Monster difficulty modifying code rewritten for free space and improved;
+	Church monster resists revised;
+	Sathgor now resists lightning;
+	Small boost of damage absorption on some high level unique armors and helms;
+	Grim Reaper gives more AC: [130-200] > [176-200];
+	Crypt music now has stereo quality and higher bitrate (will require downloading new music file);
+	Character maximum resistance is 85% now;
+	1.57f_09 > Rewritten some of resistance display code, gained 48 bytes free space;


	v1.57h

+	Arcane Star damage formula updated: 40*SLVL + 4*CurMAG;
+	Fire & Lightning Nova damage increased by ~20%;
+	Staves with spells: recharge and price cost, defined by spell type, revised;
+	Roman Armor > Roman Leather Armor;


	v1.57i

+	DLVL [1-3] monster damage revised (a bit less, in general);
+	Huge Sword damage: [20-85] > [13-92], this way it's better for stun mechanics;
+	Blazing Wrath: +damage% is now [200-300];
+	Church level architecture update (SOL);
+	Werewolves: reverberation increased for 2nd howling sound;
+	Melee double-rate attackers on DLVL 4 have their damage reduced (this makes them easier on Horror and has almost no impact for higher difficulty modes), bosses still unaffected;
+	Werewolves: resistance update (used to be quadra-immune on Doom) - now they resist Magical damage;
+	Staves with +ToHit% prefix won't cost as much as before (thx to Mollari for pointing that out);


	v1.57j

+	Dark Mages: MLVL reduced by 1, -15 XP points, -35% HP;
+	Magistrate: -35% HP;
+	Many ranged attackers have their HP decreased;
+	Blood Knights: less damage, faster walking, less minHP;


	v1.57j RC2

+	Max DFE capped at CurrentVIT / 2 (for ex., a character with CurVIT 60 won't go over 30 DFE), this makes VIT more important as a stat and ensures smoother DFE increase;
+	The Ghost > Soulflayer;


	v1.57j RC3
+	Decreased ToHit [-50] on Gorewhipper replaced with Decreased MAG [20-30], now this sword will be used mainly by Paladins because Gladiators usually won't have enough Magic;


	v1.57m

+	Grotesque: AC decreased by 20 points on all difficulty modes (being so damn BIG, they should be easier to hit);
+	Engart's Maul > Thunderclap, Scepter of Pacification > Scepter of Engart;
+	Abyss stairs up message fixed: 'up to abyss lvl #' -> 'up to abyss level #' ;
+	New Grotesque boss on Abyss floor 2: Tantorus. Has pack, very high subtype, almost doesn't delay when attacking and chasing, has randomly triggered activation sound (growl);
+	Item drop rate revised and drop randomness increased;
+	Kain's Valor could be found on Pigface Bascinet (shared same unique item number with Embossed Mail): fixed;
+	Part of affix data relocated for free space for enlarged base item data table;


	v1.57n

+	Many monsters' HP values revised again (all for better gameplay);
+	Suffix of Zest costs less: 1000 > 200;
+	Suffix of Zest is now available on shields;


	v1.57n RC2

+	Borje has less HP: 6000 > 2800;
+	Sabazias' resistance updated: quadra immune > immune to F,L,SC and resistant to M;


	v1.57p

+	Speed enhancement suffixes limited to Speed (+2) and Haste (+4), others never worked since Diablo, so no use;
+	Added suffix of Bashing (piercing 50% of monster's armor), it will never be found on items together with {+ToHit%} or {+ToHit% and +Damage%};
+	Affixes completely revised for better balance (affix morphing can happen, but it's all for the good);
+	Prefixes of {+ToHit%, +Damage%} are given more fitting names;
+	Shemmir > Boilrot, and has lower subtype, quite nice for DLVL-1 now (not too hard, not too easy);
+	Knockback series affixes revised for better availability and smoother price escalation;


	v1.57q

+	Suffix of Thorns is back, deals RND[1-100] damage (perhaps, later it would be wiser to connect it to CLVL or MLVL, we'll see);
+	Some unique item revision (minor);


	v1.57q RC1

+	Items of Thorns cost less (item price multiplier decreased: 8 > 5);


	v1.57q RC2

+	Monsters do less damage when casting Flash spell (still, I recommend maxing out magic resistance when facing flashers);


	v1.57q RC10

+	Relocated affix data;
+	Resistance prefixes revised;


	v1.57q RC17

+	Unique item text relocated;


	v1.57q RC18

+	More text relocated;


	v1.57r

+	Relicts of Infravision cost less: 600 -> 200;


	v1.57s

+	Reapers' hit recovery speed increased: 6 -> 4;
+	Reapers: less HP [600-900] -> [600-700], as a result they are less boring and more fun;
+	Base monster damage values revised;


	v1.57t

+	Characters now have passive life regeneration (at a fixed rate though, mayhap later I'll connect it to Vitality);
+	Shredded: animation fixed;
+	Death Guardian: slower idle animation;
+	Monsters gain 50% less life from warcries as before;
+	Corrupt Order: less MaxDamage (to make Gloom Clan always do more damage);
+	Several Hell palettes updated;
+	Slightly larger boss packs;
+	Greater Demons & Abyss Guardians now have less HP (~30% less);


	v1.57u

+	Many monsters received support for Lich and Arch-Lich (Soul Burner) spell effects (will be used for new bosses in future);
+	Many monsters with Goat Archer AI have less chance to retreat now (this will surely make battle for melee fighters less frustrating), Gloom Clan and Soul Burners still retreat as before.
	Monsters changed : >>>
	- goat archers (except gloom clan)
	- witches (except soul burners)
	- beholders
	- fire & poison bats
	Bosses can still be more cautious and retreat faster than their corresponding base monsters;


	v1.57u RC1

+	Paladins, Monks, Assassins and Gladiators now have ~30% chance to avoid knockback in MvP melee;


	v1.57u RC5

+	Prefix of Sharp renamed to Deadly;
+	Prefixes of {+ToHit%, +Damage%} series have their maximum damage values revised;
+	Monsters now have slightly less +HP bonus for higher difficulties (Boss HP modifier unchanged);
+	Shredded: animation fix again;
+	Bembuz -> Icebone Freezeaxe;


	v1.57v

+	Rewrote Life regeneration code (now regenerate 1/64HP per 1/20sec + 1/64HP per every 8 points of BaseVitality, and double regeneration rate in town);
+	Added Mana regeneration (same formula as with life regeneration, based on BaseMagic);
+	Fixed Paladin and Gladiator (Glad's fix needs his file - thglad.mor) animation (neutral, mace+shield, in dungeon, south-west direction <- used to be same as for west direction);


	v1.57v RC1

+	A critical fix: because of increased mob size, there was a monster amount overlap in Pandemonium, which casued gamecrash after entering the level, now fixed;
+	Diablo's room in Pandemonium is no longer open;


	v1.57v RC2

+	Barrels do less damage (restored original values -> [8-16], damage type = Fire);


	v1.57v RC4

+	In MP mode Leoric, Uber, Blood Legion and Werewolves steal life, 100% of damage they cause is added to their current life;
+	Shrine names can be seen again;


	v1.57v RC5

+	Sparkling Shrine now can appear as early as DLVL 1 (as before, both SP and MP);


	v1.57v RC7

+	Life and mana regeneration revised: 1/64HP every 0.05 sec per every 8 points of Base VIT/MAG, if required attribute is lower than 8, no regeneration;
+	Mage starting stats revised: 10STR-35MAG-5DEX-10VIT -> 10STR-35MAG-10DEX-5VIT;


	v1.57w
+	Plague Warriors: max damage reduced by 2 points;
+	Byclops: Attack CL2 animation corrected;
+	Byclops: Neutral CL2 animation corrected;
+	Multiplayer games of Purgatory mode will become unavailable only for CLVL 45+ players;


	v1.57w RC1

+	Grizwold no longer restricts himself to the item types that current player doesn't have (this gives way better variety at his shop);


	v1.57w RC2

+	Some Crypt palettes corrected (coming with new HellDataFile archive);
+	Melee PvP completely disabled and cleared 586 bytes of codespace, do me a favor and test this in coop games by engaging each other in melee, if you won't be able to hit each other for, say, 200 hits and the game doesn't crash, it's OK then, I'd also like to receive report on this on the forum to make sure it can be implemented and that future updates can be based on that version;


	v1.57x

+	Many monster and boss resistances corrected and updated;


	v1.57x RC4

+	Assassin received new entering speech for DLVL 1;

+	Flash spell used to have a bug: applied quickfix (later the spell will be optimzed);


	v1.57x RC8

+	Some value wrap-around issues (on unique items) were fixed;
+	Hoop of Magma: less +Fire Resist [60-70];
+	Gotterdamerung: clumsiness effect replaced with -SLVL;
+	Fire arrows damage effect on Hoop of Magma replaced with Thorns effect;
+	Less Vitality bonus from Hoop of Magma: [20-30] -> [10-20];
+	Hoop of Magma: DFE goes from fixed -3 to random [2-4];
+	Pendant of Deceit: AC penalty replaced with Mana penalty [20-40];


	v1.57x RC9

+	Hidden and Murphy shrines were disabled to put an end to random crashes with players touching those;


	v1.57y

+	Abyss level palette #61 added to data archive to prevent gamecrash (this error had 1/60th chance to occur upon loading one of Abyss levels);


	v1.57y RC2

+	Monster stun formula: MLVL*4  >>>>  MLVL*8 (it's better this way);
+	Monster's life: in Purg ((Horror*1,5)+960) and Doom ((Horror*2)+2000), bosses use the same formulae as before: Purg ((Horror*3)+1280) and Doom ((Horror*4)+2016);


	v1.57y RC3

+	Characters receive new ability: Evasion. It gives them ability to dodge monsters' attacks (both melee and missile) by (BaseDEX/4)%. For ex., Gladiator with BaseDEX of 40 has 10% chance to dodge attacks, Scout with BaseDEX of 120 has 30% chance to dodge attacks, etc.;
+	On the other hand, monsters now have no automiss (used to have 5% + CLVL/4), characters rely on their Basic Dexterity now, completely;


	v1.57y RC4

+	Holy Bolt damage formula updated: CLVL + rnd[19-38];


	v1.57y RC5

+	Experience is no longer shared between players in Multiplayer. Now it's getting more realistic. Thanks to Orachin for putting my brains in the right direction on this matter;


	v1.58

+	Monster HP display modified from "max/cur" to "max\cur";
+	Characters' Lightning spell damage formula changed to: (Rnd[CLVL] + Rnd[10] + 5) * 4;
+	Fiery Blast damage formula set to: Rec(slvl, 2 * (Rnd[10] + Rnd[10] + clvl) + 4), and missile speed to 8 + 2*SLVL, up to the maximum of 50 (you start off with slower FB now);
+	Apocalypse books disabled completely, staves with Apocalypse will no longer be sold by Adria and will be a bit harder to find, Apocalypse charges on staves reduced to Rnd[1-3];
+	Bone Spirit damages monsters more: 1/6 cur.life -> 1/4 cur.life;
+	Fire/Lightning Nova does a little more damage, but still its damage strongly depends on SLVL (don't be upset that it's weak, it's not, you just have to get the SLVL high enough);
+	Arcane Star costs more mana to cast (initial 30, decreased by 1 per SLVL, minimum 10 mana), book price raised to 14000, charges on staves = Rnd[30-50];
+	Aglamith: damage decreased;
+	'AC vs Undead' bonus decreased to +10 AC, AC vs Demons reduced to +15 AC;
+	The difference between MLVL and CLVL is now less important for determining chance to hit in MvP (melee and missile), Hellfire original formula restored;
+	Because of the change above all of the AC data in unique items section was revised;
+	Monsters' ToHit formulae were modified for gradual escalation of ToHit: now players need AC up to 100 on Horror, 200 on Purgatory and 300 on Doom, for further info visit TH Forum;
+	Obsolete +AC% series affixes were replaced with other (more suitable) bonuses (this will cause some of affix data morph into other affix, but there's no real cause for panic);
+	Some further base item AC adjustments;
+	Some cursed affixes are back (-AC%, -damage%, -tohit% and -damage%);
+	Prefixes of +charges are also back now (Plentiful & Bountiful);
+	Introduced prefixes of AC bonus vs Undead/Demons;
+	Charge amounts on staves are limited to the maximum of 80 to prevent problems with "+charges" prefixes;


	v1.58a

+	AC balance issues were fixed;
+	Monster ToHit modifiers for difficulty modes were modified so that AC required fpr Horror mode is 1-100, Purgatory 100-200 and Doom 200-300;
+	AC balance was adjusted so that some monsters will have increased chance to hit with their special attack and bosses will require more AC (+8), rulers will require most high AC;


	v1.58a RC1

+	Durability Icons appear for items with current durability 7 (yellow) and 3 (red);


	v1.58a RC2

+	Evasion mechanics updated. MELEE: Evasion = 0 + (BaseDEX / 8)%, autohit = 22%, MISSILE: Evasion = 2 + (BaseDEX / 4)%, Autohit = 20%;


	v1.58a RC5

+	Flesh Clan: small increase of special damage, special attack tohit increased by 1%;
+	Gloomy Shrine adds 1 AC now;
+	Critical hits in melee combat now caused by all classes (except for Mage), formulae is still the same: CLVL% chance for double damage. This improves Monk and Assassin balance;
+	Monster stun formula reverted back to MLVL*4;


	v1.58b

+	Again rebalanced monsters' ToHit (+4 AC per level increase required for best protection, up to AC100 for Clvl30 players on Horror);
+	Suffixes of +VIT series revised;
+	AC revised on many body armors;
+	Requirements revised on many body armors;
+	Modified AC and requirements on shields and helms;
+	SubREV158a_15: Adria will buy items back at lower price than before: 25% -> 12,5% (just like Grizwold);


	v1.58b RC3

+	Monsters on Doom mode somehow had less HP than specified, found the bug and fixed it;
+	Chance for blocking is now based on baseDEX instead of current. Vs Melee monsters it's max 80%, vs ranged attackers it's max 75% chance;


	v1.58c

+	Evasion and DFE limitation didn't work properly, now it's fixed;


	v1.58d

+	Monsters AC balance completely rewritten for better gameplay. On Horror you'll meet monsters with AC of 1 - 85, on Purgatory 86 - 170, on Doom 171 - 255;
+	Paladin's inherent ToHit bonus lowered: +20% -> +5%;
+	Warrior's Band gives less +%damage: [50-100] -> [20-60];


	v1.58e

+	PvM melee: minimum tohit = 2%, maximum tohit = 92%;
+	PvM (melee, arrow and spells) have base tohit of 25% now;
+	PvMmelee: FTH = 25 + Dex + ToHit(items) + Clvl + bonus(player) - AC(monster) - penalty(quarter damage);
+	Character stats menu updated (always shows correct ToHit% now, but CLVL still needs to be added on top of that, perhaps will be done in the nearest future);
+	Prefixes of +%ToHit and +%ToHit,+%Damage revised;
+	Effects with +%ToHit and Armor Percing still won't be found on one item;
+	MvPmelee: autohit = 20%;
+	MvPmissile: autohit = 15%;
+	Paladin's inherent ToHit bonus (when using bows & crossbows) set to 10%;
+	SubREV158dz4: Armor Piercing updated: Piercing > ignore 12,5% AC, Puncturing > 18,75% AC, Bashing > 25%;
+	Gladiators receive +6,25% on top of AP bonus (18,75%, 25% and 31,25% respectively);
+	ToHit bonus from Armor Piercing is not displayed at character page (because the bonus depends on the current monster's AC, it varies, and can never be shown correctly);
+	Helm of Glory greatly enhanced (because of increased requirements);
+	PvM missile: minimum tohit = 1%, maximum tohit = 93%;


	v1.58e RC1

+	Added support for new music MPQ file: HellMF2.mpq;


	v1.58e RC2

+	Normal arrow trap: DLVL modifier damage reduced from dlvl*32 to dlvl*16;


	v1.58f

+	Monks and Assassins do +300% critical damage (others do +100%, as before);
+	Mages can cause critical hits in melee. Still not very useful for them;
+	Monk's magic cast animation decreased: 13 -> 16;
+	Minor adjustments to Monk's unique staves;


	v1.58g

+	Heart Seeker can now be found on Composite Staff, too;
+	Less max DFE on Sabiru's Hideout;
+	Conquistador made indestructible, and max DFE raised;
+	Civerb's Vest has higher durability;
+	Heart Seeker: +%tohit +%damage changed to +[200-300]% damage;


	v1.58h

+	Trap damage is now varied for dlvl and difficulty. Less damage at the beginning, in general. Use '2007-12-14, 21-01, Traps Damage Increase.txt' for debug;
+	Trap damage revised for smoother increase (Xcept for Lite). Still, don't expect a calm promenade. And Scouts that won't use their skill will shoot themselves in the foot (grin);


	v1.58i

+	Monster HitPoints completely revised so that many monsters on Horror mode have less HP than before and HP amount grows smoother (check 'Formulae.XLS' for further details);
+	Difficulty modifiers for monster hitpoints are modified too. Monsters: Purg:  (Hor*1,5)+960, Doom: (Hor*4)+2240. Bosses: Purg: (Hor*3)+1280, Doom: (Hor*4)+3200;
+	Empyrean Axe lost its +%damage bonus;
+	Minor adjustments in monster resistances;


	v1.58j

+	Flash damage from monsters depends on their minimum damage (this way it's much better balanced for difficulty mode purpose);
+	Aglamith's damage corrected: [18-48] -> [5-50];
+	Affix prices thoroughly adjusted for better economy balance. Gold now plays larger role;
+	Missile Evasion formula update: 5% + (BaseDEX / 4)%;


	v1.58j SV5

+	Now I will use term 'Sub Version' instead of 'Release Candidate';
+	Further adjustments in monster resists (with new HP stats some used to die to Lightnings way too fast);
+	Suffixes of Fire/Lite arrows and Life/Mana leech cost less;
+	Magic books: prices revised;
+	Adria is more greedy: return price goes from 1/8 to 1/16;
+	Unique item prices revised;


	v1.58j SV6

+	Monster hit points are displayed in a different way: "Hit Points : [current] of [base]" ;


	v1.58j SV7

+	Mage's maximum DEX is now 80, maximum VIT is 100;


	v1.58k

+	Shadow Weaver renamed to Nightmare;
+	Grizwold repairs items at lower price (-50% price), but his return price has gone down again (now it's 1/16 or 6,25%);
+	Spiritual Fortress: +%AC changed to random +[5-35]%;
+	Damage bonus from VIT (when using axe) for Gladiator class reduced: VIT*CLVL / 50 -> VIT*CLVL / 75;
+	Durability loss speed on bows lowered: 1/50 -> 1/70;
+	When using bows, Scouts deal +300% damage (Critical Hit) with a chance of (1+(CLVL/2))%;


	v1.58l

+	Warping Demons: used to be only resistant to magic on Doom mode. Now resistant to Lightning (to give Scouts a chance for survival);
+	Town revised: portals appear at their default site, NPCs relocated, architecture modified;


	v1.58l SV3

+	Small Bow damage: [2-7] > [2-8]. This will allow starting Scouts to stun monsters in the beginning with a chance of ~15%;
+	DLVL 1-3 monsters have HP decreased by ~15%;
+	Aglamith & Kroganon: maximum damage reduced;


	v1.58l SV5

+	Suffixes of +Life/+Mana rebalanced (Heal all your characters before upgrading!);


	v1.59

+	Some Boars' Hit sound improved;
+	Armors & Helmets: durability revised;
+	Bow durability goes down a little faster: 1/70 -> 1/60;
+	Scout's base damage modified to: (CLVL * (STR + DEX)) / 150. Less dependant on bow damage, more dependant on her CLVL, STR & DEX stats;
+	Monsters do a little less damage with Flash (damage formula still has to be rewritten though, in the future);
+	Lightning from monster is now less aggressive;
+	Rod of blood shaman gives less AC: [50-100] -> [10-15];
+	Anvil of the ages is no longer findable (use oils to increase item durability);
+	Gladiators now get stunned if final damage received is greater than their CLVL (same formula as for others). Thanx to Orachin for explaining this;
+	Grim Reaper adds to VIT instead of STR: +[11-15] points of VIT added;
+	Amazon's Corset improved, but DEX penalty is still there;
+	Grizwold's repair cost increased by 50%;
+	Thorough price rebalancing in affix data;
+	Glass and Crysstalline items cannot be sold anymore (can be found only);
+	Fixed Hell Clan's 2nd death sound (used to have a short delay at the beginning);
+	A lot of monsters and their bosses relocated for better monster variety on levels (inspired by someone's post on TH forum);


	v1.59a

+	Flash damage from monsters is now much better balanced (however, North, North-East and East directions don't cause expected damage. Probably, will be updated later);
+	Same about Lightning damage from monsters - escalates smooth but steady (my ultra high-protection geared Paladin still gets hurt in Crypt by Varaya's flash pretty bad and Aglamith now barely damages characters at the beginning);


	v1.59a SV1

+	A gamecrash issue was fixed on DLVL 6 loading (wrong boss for Unseen pack);


	v1.59b

+	Gold drop balance improved. Now you'll have to treat it with caution and utilize more oils, +be careful when using Glass/Crystalline items - they are not supposed to be your main weapon (repair cost is high, you'll go broke, use such items on bosses/packs only);


	v1.59c

+	Hidden and Illusion Weavers: HP decreased a little;
+	Monsters' Lightning damage = ( ( AC + 3 ) * 4 ), lightning attempts to hit every 0,05 sec for a total of 10 times;
+	Paladin's base damage formula set to: ( ( CLVL * STR ) / 50);


	v1.59d

+	Effective DFE value is now displayed in character menu;
+	Fury no longer affects maximum DFE;

+	Melee PvP: blocking is based on baseDEX, max block chance = 70% (rev 1.62e_11);

+	Grim demons recolored again;
+	Ragnakk's color translation update;
+	Zabulon: recolored (thx to Pingy for pointing this out);
+	Skeleton King used to have Bone creepers as guards and they always had butcher's attack type, now this should be fixed by letting them retain their original attack type and subtype;
+	Life stealing reduced: 3% ->>> 2%, 2% ->>> 1%, Increased life stealing is the same (+ Random[0 - 3,125]% life stolen per hit, average increase ~1,5%);

+	Trapped dungeon objects now can be detected by all character classes;
+	[rev_26] New formula for Healing: Class_bonus*(Rnd[4] + Itt(baseVIT, Rnd[2]+1) + Itt(SLVL, Rnd[2]+1) + 1), see 'spells.xls' for details;
+	[rev_27] Mana cost for spells is the same for all (Mage used to have -50% reduction);
+	Healing spell mana cost formula updated: 8 + (2*clvl) - (3*slvl)   - >>>  8 + (clvl+2) - (3*slvl). Note that Heal Other will require the same amount of mana as before: 8 + (2*clvl) - (3*slvl);
+	Added impact sound to Arcane Star;
+	[rev_29_1] Added impact sound to Elemental, changed Warp sound;
+	Gladiators now can score critical hits when using (cross)bows, the chance for such a hit is (3 + (CLVL/8))% and the damage increase is +100%;
+	PvP Missile_arrow: Scout has ToHit bonus of 20%, Pals nad Glads have 10% bonus;
+	PvP: FTH_arrow = 25 + curDEX_attacker + ToHit_items_attacker + CLVL_attacker + bonus_attacker - distance*distance/2 - curDEX_target/5 - AC_items_target - bonus_target;
+	PvP: FTH_spell = 25 + curMAG_attacker + bonus_attacker - 2*CLVL_target;
+	PvP Missile: both arrow and magic damage is divided by 16. Note that ARD doesn't work in PvP;
+	[rev_31] PvP Missile: minimum tohit is 1%, maximum is 93%;
+	PvP Missile blocking formula update: FB = baseDEX_target + 2*(CLVL_target - CLVL_attacker) + bonus_target, up to maximum of 80%;
+	PvP Missile: if the spell is Bone Spirit, damage is [current life_target]/3;
+	PvP Melee: minimum tohit is 2%, maximum tohit is 92%;
+	[rev_32] PvP Melee: Increased Lifestealing works just as in PvM, stealing random[0 - 3,125]% life per hit, average ~1,5%;
+	[rev_33] PvP Melee: Pals and Glads have CLVL% chance for a 2x damage critical, Monks have CLVL% chance for 4x damage critical, Assassins have CLVL% chance for 3x damage critical;
+	PvP Melee: on top of that, the final damage is divided by 16;
+	Added impact sound to arrows;
+	Magic damage is reduced further in PvP: 1/16 -> 1/64, now its damage is comparable to that of bows and is no longer so devastative;
+	PvP Melee: Increased lifestealing restored to random [0 - 12,5]% per hit because damage in PvP is lower, but still it's barely noticable;
+	Reapers no longer KB, instead they do extra damage when swinging their scythe backwards: extra attack on frame 13 with -10 points to min & max Damage and with -9% penalty to ToHit;

+	All gargoyle types are stunned if damage is > AC * 8;
+	[rev_38] Reapers, Grotesques and Flesh golems are stunned if damage is > (AC - 20) * 8;
+	[rev_39] TD53's Rage code is obviously not without problems, so previous version is restored;
+	Credits updated;
+	[rev_40] Monsters heal themselves slower: - 50% regenerate rate (approximately);
+	Fiery Blast received new impact sound;
+	Chain Lightning spell is disabled;
+	Implemented new spell: Shocking Blast - a Fiery Blast analogue that does lightning damage;
+	[rev_40+SB_02] Impact effect added to Shocking blast, seems to work ok but needs more fieldtesting;
+	[rev_41] Shocking Blast is complete, damage is Rec(slvl, Rnd[20]+Rnd[8*CLVL]+clvl+30), without splash, works very much like Fire blast, damage shown in spellbook is accurate;
+	Gladiator base damage for bows is set to ((CLVL * STR) / 62) / 2 to make them less dangerous in PvP and make bow damage look normal on character screen;
+	Gladiators' criticals with bow in PvM enhanced: 5 + (CLVL / 4)% chance for 3x damage (+200%);
+	[rev_42] Mage's base damage reduced to (CLVL * STR) / 200, while Paladin's base damage remains the same: (CLVL * STR) / 50;

+	ReadMe file revised;
+	[rev_45] Gladiators now tend to use weapons of the same type if they go dual-weidling: using sharp and blunt at the same time causes them to lose all base character damage;
+	[rev_46] Preparations made for dupe fix: the bug isn't fixed but the code chunks relocated to free space so that they can be easily modified later on;
+	[rev_47] PvP Missile: Bone Spirit does more damage: 1/6 ->> 1/2, still its effective damage will be low, because it's divided by 16 afterwards, needs testing;
+	Most monsters were stunned too easy: fixed by correcting code that checks it;
+	Bone spirit now always reduces monster's current life by 5%, spellbook shows '1/20 tgt hp' which is practically the same;
+	Arrow trap tohit chance formula updated: (100 - 2*dist - player_total_AC/2)% ->>> (250 - dist - player_total_AC/2)%;

+	Again, some adjustments to uniques;

+	[rev_52] Introduced new suffix: Detect traps ('...of thieves'). It allows the user to detect all trapped objects;
+	Stash will display 'Rings' instead of 'Bngls' now, and 'Amulets' instead of 'Collars';
+	Resist #%MAX displayed for 85% resistance, not 75% as before;
+	Firewall, Litewall, Flamering & Litering spells would irritate by not ending at high SLVLs, they also ended too fast at very low SLVL: corrected by increasing mini duration and limiting maxi duration;


	v1.64 SV1

+	A small fix that corrects display on items: '+%ToHit, +%Damage' series items used to show '-25% mana cost';


	v1.64a

+	Bone Spirit now does full damage in PvP, reducing opponent's current life by 20%;
+	PvP spell damage divide update: 1/64 ->>> 1/16. This could be changed later on, needs testing, 1/64 does almost neglectible damage even to non-resistant characters;
+	Assassin's hit recovery speed: 7 ->>> 6;
+	Assassin's PvP spell tohit bonus: 10% ->>> 40% (just as in PvM);
+	Assassin receives new base damage for different weapon combinations: Sword + Sword: (DEX * CLVL) / 60;

+	Max block chance in PvP melee is 50% now;
+	PvP spell damage divide update: 1/16 ->>> 1/8. This is optimal, but don't oppose mages if your resists are too low. 40-70% is enough I think, Thanks to Orachin and Oli for lots of testing;
+	PvP melee: Paladin loses his innate tohit bonus (+20%) and Gladiator receives innate tohit bonus(+35%). Thanks to Oli for thoroughly testing it;
+	Max blocking in PvP melee is 45% now;
+	Uber's HP goes down: 15400 ->>> 12000;


	v1.64c

+	Suffix of 'the angel' renamed to 'exorcism';

+	(comes with next full release) Added 15 more palettes to Church levels;
+	(comes with next full release) Added 15 more palettes to Catacomb levels;
+	Koven's reported bug fixed. Doom archers could crash the game when being forced to appear from brokem urns on level 22. One-byte fix does it by giving them support for second animation;


	v1.64g

+	(comes with next full release) Added 15 more palettes to Cave levels;
+	Many a base item had its magic name corrected;
+	Stiletto renamed to Dirk (fits more and is shorter), magic name is also 'Dirk';
+	Minor damage adjustments on some bows;
+	Assassin's mace swing speed increased: 9 ->>> 8. Now she has same attack speed with swords and maces;
+	Due to a simple bug Flayed Ones could appear on dlvl 13 with their boss copying Chaos Knight boss Caballot. Nothing awful, but it wasn't meant to be this way. Now it's fixed;
+	Dlvl 1 skeletons hurt less, especially archers. This makes beginning less hard and gives time to prepare for venturing deeper and acquiring more AC, ARD and DFE;
+	Gladiator casts spells one frame earlier: 18 ->>> 17;
+	Town Portal spell: mana cost decrease per SLVL: 2 ->>> 1;
+	PvM Melee: Monk & Assy deal 3x damage with criticals, other classes deal 2x damage. All have CLVL% chance to cause such a hit. The code is optimized and relocated. A small bug fixed;

+	(comes with next full release) Scout's heavy armor magic spell cast animation revised;

+	New unique items, based on new and old items, changes are numerous, documented in workshop;
+	Base+unique item addon plan is far from finished but some massive testing needed already;
+	Pit demons and Flayed ones used to have quad immunity instead of triple imunity: fixed by making them vulnerable to SC. The only quad immune base monster now is Soul Burner (on Doom mode);
+	Unfortunately, unique item numbers is limited to 128, so currently I'll limit them to 128. The rest of the uniques are moved below the table to be activated later on (if we succeed with removing that restriction);
+	Pal/Glad death animations (with items) added to data file, hopefully will be activated in the nearest future. Animations taken from Diablo Alpha remake and converted by Gladoo;
+	Restored some old item images because they were in conflict with Modders' Codex rule #1;

+	Abyss palette number increased to 75;
+	Crypt palette number increased to 75, + many old ones were fixed/replaced;

+	Arcanse Star object hit sound no longer stops other sounds playing, same about leather armor class flip + inv sounds;
+	Fire- and Lite arrows received shooting and hitting sounds;
+	Modified sounds for ShockBlast;
+	A new ReadMe file is written, on russian language. It's a copy of default readme file;
+	Created a row of crossbows oriented for strength characters (Gladoo's suggestion);
+	New crossbows lower total AC of the weilder, making him/her further vulnerable in melee. This is done to promote using them mostly against shooters;
+	Doomsayer revised: penalties are the same but accuracy and damage are increased, plus it has a better image now. Now this thing will prove more useful to gladiators, even in PvP;
+	New base item: Ethereal Bow. The most damageing bow, but requires some extra MAG to weild and lowers weilder's AC;
Note:	No unique items were removed from the game, but some can morph into other uniques after upgrade. Some base items will also morph. It would be wise to backup your characters prior to upgrading...


	v1.65 RC1

+	Subversions will again be named RC;
+	Black knights no longer appear on dlvl 15. This caused Warlord of Blood appear there in SP mode (after being killed on dlvl 13 as a quest boss). In MP, Warlord will still appear on dlvl 15, as usual;

	v1.65a RC1

+	Some spells do knockback now;


	v1.65a RC2

	v1.65d

+	All shooters' retreat chances are revised, and they depend on difficulty mode now: the higher the mode the more they will retreat;
+	Shooters delay less after attack: Rnd[20]/20 seconds ->>> Rnd[4]/20 seconds. This increases their DPS decently. It doesn't affect fast spitting hounds though (they use special attack for spitting, which causes no delay at all);
+	Gloom Clan will no longer follow their target, which will make them more dangerous in certain situations;


	v1.65e

+	Skeleton archers are more hostile on higher difficulties: attack more often but their retreat chances are still very low (undead have no fear);
+	Horned demon AI adjusted to give less delays when attacking, for higher difficulty modes. Horror monsters are weaker than before, Purg & Doom - stronger;


	v1.65f

+	All shooters (except for fast spitting hounds) now have variable delays after attacks and the delay timings depend on difficulty mode strongly;

+	PvM Missile: Paladin & Gladiator now have more fitting innate ToHit bonus of +40% (used to be +70%);
+	Succubi's stars have varying colors from level to level (always the same color on the same level though);
+	Grizwold's item level cap increased: 30 ->> 40 (this allows for better items in his shop);

+	Shocking Blast renamed to Lightning Ball;
+	Lightning Ball received new missile gfx color (edited by me) and new explosion gfx (edited by Gladoo & me);

	v1.65k

+	Magma & Lightning demons now make longer delays on Horror and usual delays on Purgy. Do I have to tell you Doom mode ones will not delay?;
+	Magma & Lightning demons now favor melee attacks over ranged ones in genearal and when at melee distance;
+	Magma & Lightning demons' attack rate now strongly depends on difficulty mode. This makes them mostly easier, but Doomsters are harder now;


	v1.65k RC2

+	Horny AI: attack rate balanced much better now. (IntF*2)+4 on Horror, (IntF*4)+26 on Purgy, (IntF*2)+70 on Doom (almost no delays);

	v1.65m

+	Grim Demons subtype lowered: 9 ->> 8;
+	Grim Demon boss on floor 16h has his subtype set to 9;
+	Overlord AI rewritten, now attack rate depends on difficulty mode;
+	Overlord AI: secondary attack is now used rarely on Horror mode, more often on Purgy (and monsters with higher subtype use special attack more often on Purgy), and Doom mode monsters with this attack type will use special attack very often and without delays (the percentage still depends on IntF);
+	Overlord AI: chance for uninterrupted follow is IntF*2+58 on Horror (64-76%), IntF*2+70 on Purgy (76-88%) and IntF*2+82 on Doom (88-100%);

+	War sallet used to have blunt weapon magic code: now fixed;


	v1.65v

+	Weapons that used to lower character's AC do so no more because this didn't work as intended and gave huge AC bonus instead of lowering AC;

	v1.82d

+	Multiplayer savegame files no longer depend on computer network name (patch by Fuco):
	WARNING!
	This is imperative that people who have Multiplayer characters do the following to avoid losing their MP characters:
	step 0. backup your current MP characters (see Readme on how to find them, if you don't know what they are),
	step 1. load zTHv182cRC2-converter.exe (this file is included in this release),
		Note: for this conversion you HAVE to use a computer with the same network name as the one used for creating your MP characters,
		Note 2: the converter does NOT read Single-player characters, this is done on purpose,
	step 2. go to 'Multiplayer' and pick your first MP character,
	step 3. start the game with it,
	step 4. when your character appears in town, click 'Menu' and 'Quit The Hell'. This converted your character;
	step 5. goto step 1 until all of your Multiplayer characters are gone,
	step 6. load the game as normal (TheHell.exe), you should be able to see all your MP characters now, they no longer depend on computername,
		Note: again, don't use 'zTHv182cRC2-converter.exe' to play: its sole purpose is to change MP savegame files,
	If you experience problems, report on forum thread (http://diablothehell.freeforums.org/version-1-83-in-development-t327.html);

+	THdata.mor archive is repacked for size decrease;
+	Suffixes of '+life' & '+mana' revised;
+	Multiplayer savegame files are now converted automatically (Desert Dragon's improvement to Fuco's patch),
	Note: this makes converting exe from 1.82d useless (delete it),
	Note2: new system recognizes both old and new characters, but it automatically converts old characters to new format after you've played them,
	Note3: after conversion, new characters are no longer compatible with old versions of TH (prior to 1.82d);
+	Multiplayer savefiles are now saved as non-hidden - attribute changes after you've played with a certain character (Desert Dragon's patch);

	horror: (mlvl/2)+5,

+	Added chests (for additional rewards) on Lazarus' quest level;
+	'Halls of the Blind' quest: added 2 Illusion Weavers to the room with the reward;

+	Monster C1h is given higher stun threshold: (mAC*8);
+	Added bosspack with monster C1h as boss and monster C2h as minions;
+	Added support for monsters C2h and C1h on MP Doom dlvl-12;
+	Monster C1h is given additional attack on frame 9 with following mods: +37 ToHit, 2x max.damage (minimum - the same);
+	Monster C1h is given KB immunity;
+	Monsters 6Eh (Diablo), 89h (Uber), C1h & C2h are given support for mana damage;
+	Monster C2h will warp if stunned;
+	Monsters C1h & C2h will add 800% of the damage they deal to their current HP;
+	Adding monster C2h: C1h's minion;
+	Monster C2h: stun threshold set to (mAC+90). This will result in effective threshold [150-450];
+	Mana trap: sound changed;
+	New uberbosses (dlvls 4, 8 & 12) are given triple drop;
+	Monsters C1h, C3h & C5h receive +50 to MLVL on Doom (instead of standard +30). This is uberboss-specific mlvl increase;
+	Adding monster C3h;
+	Monster C3h made stun-immune;
+	Added support for monsters C3h and C4h on MP Doom dlvl-4;
+	Monster C3h made able to cross fire walls;
+	Monster C4h made able to cross lightning walls;
+	Monster C3h made immune to KB;
+	Monster C3h is given activation sound (similar to monster 33h);

+	Monster C5h is given additional melee attack on frame 7: +37% accuracy, random (100-200)% damage;
+	Monster C6h gains only 50% of extra hitpoints for Doom mode. Uberboss creation for MP Doom dlvl-8 is now complete;
+	Small healing/mana/holy potions now add life/mana according to game mode:
	Horror:		+[25,0 - 62,5]%,
	Purgatory:	+[12,5 - 62,5]%,
	Doom:		+[12,5 - 50,0]%;
+	Added 2 pet bosses to Uber's room on MP Doom. This is done to increase challenge of the final battle;
+	Added monster C7h. Activated for levels 13-16. Supplied with bosses. Given unusual boss in Pandemonium;
+	Monster C7h is given 50% lower HP increase for difficulty modes;
+	Elixirs are given different inscriptions;
+	Shrines that increase stats had their messages adjusted;
+	Added monster C8h. Made inactive because there's 200 monster slot limitation. More monster slots should be enabled first;
+	Mage AI expanded by forcing different mage spells on dlvls 13 & 14 (this is experimental, gotta try to tie it to a certain monster slot);
+	Monk class is given its own inventory screen. He's no longer using Mage screen;
+	Revised monster placement on Lazarus (SP) level (some witches used to appear on brazier tiles);
+	Removed Illusion Weavers from Halls of the Blind rooms - this caused them to appear in barrels, was too hard for SP Horror,
	Note: I should differentiate HoB quest rooms and monsters for difficulty modes in the nearest future, probably rewards for classes, too;
+	DLVL-5 Shadow boss given a shorter name;
+	Crown of Spirits gives less AC and increases DFE (+DFE...);
+	Introducing new feature: "Mordor's stat limitations" (MSL). Character total base stat sum now will be limited accordiing to the following rules:
	for CLVL (1-15):	(CLVL*7)+60,
	for CLVL (16-20):	(CLVL*7)+70,
	for CLVL (21-25):	(CLVL*8)+80,
	for CLVL (26-30):	(CLVL*8)+90,
	for CLVL (31-35):	(CLVL*9)+100,
	for CLVL (36-40):	(CLVL*9)+110,
	for CLVL (41-45):	(CLVL*10)+120,
	for CLVL 46+:		unlimited,
	Note: if total base stat sum reaches the limit, stats will become golden and won't be a subject to increase until the formula allows it again,
	Note: neither free distributable points, nor shrines, nor elixirs will allow to increase total stat amount beyond what's allowed by MSL,
	Note: all character classes will become able to maximize all stats only after reaching character level 46;
+	According to MSL rules, levelup stat gains won't exceed sums that can be added until the limit is reached,
	Note: this was done to prevent game engine from giving players stat points that would be wasted;
+	Characters with stat sum exceeding MSL, will be given no respec (and respect ,-) ) from shrines;
+	Introducing new feature: "Mordor's forced anti-cheating" (MFA). If a character has base stat sum that exceeds MSL limit, stats are lowered,
	Note: Base stats are lowered randomly until they've reached MSL limit,
	Note: no base stat can be set below 15 this way;
+	Respec doesn't work if MSL is reached. Actually, it's a bug. But I doubt that it's worth fixing;
+	Character mana formulae revised:
	Paladin:  	baseMAG + curMAG + CLVL + Mana_items - 1 ,
	Scout:  	baseMAG + 1.5*curMAG + 2*CLVL + Mana_items + 5,
	Mage:  		2*baseMAG + 2*curMAG + 2*CLVL + Mana_items - 2,
	Monk:  		baseMAG + 1.5*curMAG + 2*CLVL + Mana_items + 5,
	Assassin: 	1.5*baseMAG + 2.5*curMAG + 2*CLVL + Mana_items + 3,
	Gladiator:  	baseMAG + curMAG + 0.5*CLVL + Mana_items + 0;
+	MFA feature expanded: added support for character life/mana recalculation. Lost/gained life/mana modified retroactively;
+	Introducing new feature: Executioner mode. Characters of inappropriate level who play on forbidden Multiplayer modes, will be punished,
	Note: this mode activates ONLY in multiplayer, and if using characters of too high level (32+ for Horror, and 46+ on Purgatory),
	Note: Executioner mode increases damage from monsters tremendously and makes them ignore player's DFE as well,
	Note: I hereby announce that my work with anti-cheating for version 1.109 is finished;
+	Golem HP formula set to: (MaxMana+(slvl*25)+(dlvl*25))*diff, where diff is 1 for Horror, 4 for Purgatory and 8 for Doom,
	Note: this should make Golem less sturdy on Horror, and more useful on Doom,
	Note: this also has a side bonus of taking dungeon level and slvl into account when determining Golem HP;
+	Golem AC used to be set to 70 at all times. Now his AC value obeys this formula: ((slvl+10)*4)-20,
	Note: this should result in more hits taken early (Horror), and in less hits taken later (Purg./Doom);
+	Added several item pics from Oli and LeGioN;
+	Some unique item pics changed;
+	Steel knights are given new names that explain their essence better;
+	Uber has less pet bosses on MP Doom: 4 >> 2;
+	Golem attacks slower (restoring original timing): 10 >> 12;
+	Changing MvM stun formula from (mAC-2) to ((mAC/2)+MLVL),
	Note: this should balance out Golem's stun effectiveness on other monsters;
+	Undead are now immune to Elemental's damage;
+	Fire/Lite Nova damage calculation display formula in spellbook was fixed (at last!) to show correct info for single F.Blast/L.Ball,
	Note: don't panic :) I'm not reducing Nova damage so much. It's just a display value. They have nothing common with the real damages;
+	Fire/Lite Nova damage formula changed from:
	(Rnd[50] + Rnd[50] + Rnd[50] + Rnd[50] + Rnd[50] + clvl + 35) ^ SLVL(17/16)
	to:
	(Rnd[20] + Rnd[20] + Rnd[20] + Rnd[20] + Rnd[20] + clvl + 20) ^ SLVL(17/16);
+	Revised stats on some unique items;


	v1.109a, (15:08 28.02.2011), Full Release

+	Troompix HP raised: 75 >> 110;
+	Executioner mode used to activate in melee fight after reaching clvl-2: fixed (by correcting wrong pointers to character level);
+	Character maximum attributes revised:
	Paladin:	240-60-160-180,
	Scout:		120-70-250-150,
	Mage:		110-250-90-130,
	Monk:		160-80-220-170,
	Assassin:	130-140-210-160,
	Gladiator:	250-20-130-240;


	v1.109b, (15:13 02.03.2011), Full Release

+	Improved sound effects of death and/or hit recovery for a lot of monsters;
+	Improved death and hit recovery sounds for Monk,
	Note: these SFX modifications should increase battle satisfaction factor;
+	Updated ReadMe (ENG);


	v1.110, (18:58 14.03.2011), Full Release

+	Blood pedestals and skull piles in Hell no longer block missiles;
+	Monk attacks faster with axe/bow now: 14 >> 13;
+	Ring of Sober: revised stats;
+	Bosses received limitations on what base items their drop can be based on. Maximum stat requirement an item can have:
	Horror: 	(dlvl*5)+20,
	Purgatory:	(dlvl*5)+135,
	Doom:		unlimited,
	Note: for example, highest requirement an item from boss can have on Horror's dlvl-13 is 85, maximum req on Purgatory's dlvl-5 is 160,
	Note: each stat requirement of the processed item is checked, if any of these is higher than the formula's limit, it's marked as undroppable;
+	Doom mode bosses also received limitations, but from below. Too much to describe. Suffice it to say, there's going to be no more crap drops,
	Note: this applies only to Doom mode boss monsters, and affects the following item types: sharps/blunts/bows/axes/staves/armors/helms/shields;
+	Monsters received limitations on what base items their drop can be based on. Max stat requirement an item can have:
	Horror: 	(dlvl*5)+20,
	Purgatory:	(dlvl*5)+135,
	Doom:		unlimited;
+	[Desert Dragon]: Monsterslot table expanded from 200 to 456. Not without bugs, but still, it works. More revisions awaited;
+	Added 2 new monster types on dlvls 13 and 14. Mages;
+	Monsters C8h and C9h are given unusual Mage attacks when found on dlvls 13 & 14;
+	Added several comboattacks for Mage AI;
+	Added 4 new bosses for monsters C8h and C9h;
+	Pepin no longer provides unlimited stock of full healing potions (but they're now available among other randomly offered items);
+	Adria no longer provides unlimited stock of full mana potions (but they're now available among other randomly offered items);
+	Tried to improve image for Amulet of Resource;
+	Created 4 more uniques on uID#34;
+	Changed pictures for some base bows;
+	Added monster CAh, provided with bosses, gave lower HP boost for difficulties;
+	Monsters C8h & C9h are given phase immunity, and 50% lower HP boost for difficulties;
+	Restored soundsets for Thresher and Devil Kin;
+	Modified a lot of base item requirements;
+	Added 5 more uniques on uID#42;
+	Cape is given uID#B6h;
+	Created 7 uniques on uID#B6h;
+	Some uniques used to be unfindable: fixed by correcting qlvls;
+	Corrected damage values and prices on a lot of base items;
+	Corrected limitations of Doom mode bosses regarding what items they can't drop (this was required after changing some base item damage values);
+	Large Sword: changed picture (old one didn't really look like a base item, more like unique);
+	Large sword renamed to Flamberge (thanks to Oli for the image BTW);
+	Pepin now always sells Relict of Healing (only 50gold but slow HP gain) and Potion of Healing (100gold but fast HP gain);
+	Adria now always sells Relict of Mana (only 50gold but slow mana gain) and Potion of Mana (100gold but fast mana gain);
+	Changed some base item pictures;
+	Monk starting stats changed from 20-0-25-20 to 15-5-25-20;
+	Uber Butcher received dual attack: attacks on frames 6 and 7. But his minimum damage is lowered to compensate;
+	Uber Butcher's mob received a different AI;
+	Monsters C8h, C9h and CAh - deactivated (to prevent severe bugs because of Desert Dragon's unfinished monsterslot expansion fix);
+	Updated ReadMe files;


	v1.112, (21:40 22.03.2011), Full Release

+	Gladiator class: +1 to life regeneration rate (not affected by '+100% life regeneration rate' effect);
+	Mage class: +1 to mana regeneration rate (not affected by '+100% mana regeneration rate' effect);
+	Mage class: life regeneration rules changed. Now: (if cVIT not below 16) 66% chance for forced 0 HP regen/round instead of value by formula,
	Note: if cVIT is below 16, all classes regenerate mana at the speed of 25% chance for forced 1/64 HP regen/round, and 75% for 0 HP regen/round,
	Note: this should add a slight *classy* touch to character distinction when it comes to regeneration of life/mana;
+	Mage class gets only 50% of health restore from small healing potions;
+	Gladiator class gets only 50% of mana restore from small mana potions;
+	Improved dying sounds for Mage and Gladiator;
+	Mana spell gives mana according to the new formula:
	bonus*(Itt(clvl, Rnd[2]+1) + Itt(slvl, Rnd[2] + 1) + Rnd[4] + 1)
	to
	multiplier*(Itt(baseMAG, Rnd[2]+1) + Itt(slvl, Rnd[2] + 1) + Rnd[4] + 1)
	Note: bonus is 1x for Mage, 0,125x for Gladiator, and 0,5x for all others. This should make mana gains a lot more adequate,
	Note: relicts of mana are affected by this, too;
+	New picture given to Light flail;
+	New picture given to Composite bow;
+	Composite bow base durability set to 51, and price - to 1100 (was 1000);
+	Changed initial durability on many other base items;
+	Added 3 more uniques on uID#85;
+	Added 1 new music track: Crypt variation (by Julian Culme-Seymour, visit his site at www.crusadermusic.com);
+	DlvlN track (Crypt) improved. Music Expansion updated to v5.1;
+	Music track selection lists revised, there should be more variety now;


	v1.113, (10:52 14.04.2011), Full Release

+	Roman Leather Armor renamed to Thick Leather Armor;
+	Modified stats on Griswold's Caster bows;
+	Shield of Reflections: modified stats;
+	Created 6 uniques on uID#173;
+	Applied new pic from LeGioN to Windfury;
+	Nerfed Bloodrim & Bloomfade;
+	Changed pic for Short Knife (original looked too lame);
+	Added 8 more uniques on uID#30 (total uniques now 625);
+	Helm of Glory: nerfed;
+	Gotterdamerung: penalty increased;
+	Revised stats on uniques, based on uID#60;
+	Armet: DEX requirement lowered;
+	Again, revised some base item requirements;
+	Revised potion prices:
	small healing:		100 > 100,
	small mana:		100 > 100,
	full healing:		300 > 400,
	full mana:		300 > 400,
	holy water:		400 > 250,
	full holy water:	700 > 800;
+	Again, tons of adjustments to unique item stats;
+	Added 6 more uniques on uID#46;
+	Further adjustments to unique item stats, according to Makantal's feedback;
+	Durability loss on firing bows slightly increased: 1/50 >> 1/46;
-	Durability loss on hitting with melee weapons increased: 1/30 >> 1/25;
+	Bonus AC vs Undead/Demons increased:
	vs Undead:	+10 >> +15,
	vs Demons:	+15 >> +20;
+	Renamed some uniques;
+	Added 4 more uniques on uID#21;
+	Healing manacost revised: 8 + (2*clvl) - (3*slvl),
	Conditions: if lower than 1/8 of maxCurMana, set to maxCurMana/8; if higher than 1/4 maxCurMana, seto maxCurMana/4. Final manacost can't be below 4,
	Note: if 8+(clvl*2) is lower than (3*slvl), manacost gets set to 1. This is a bug, but I don't know how to fix it,
	Note: this improvement took me ~3 hours of coding. Thanks to this for making the time pass by smoother: youtube.com/watch?v=nLXiHyMmG20 :) ;
-	Fury no longer adds current strength and current dexterity. Instead, it adds 2*clvl to base damage and clvl/2 to AC;
+	Armor class defense made more realistic by randomizing monster accuracy in MvP Melee:
	Horror: -10, +Rnd[21],
	Purgat: -85, +Rnd[96],
	Doom:   -185, +Rnd[196],
	Note: previously, it didn't matter on Doom whether you have 200 or 0 AC. Now, on average, even leather armor will decrease monster chances to hit,
	Note: to arrive at autohit value, you will still need as much AC as before. But, for each AC point missing, monsters used to get +1% chance to hit,
	Note: now they have 1% to hit for each 3 AC points. This will allow you sometimes to sacrifice more AC for something else,
	Note: in other words, 15 AC points will no longer make a clear difference between life and death in certain conditions;
+	Randomizing monster arrow accuracy:
	Horror: 50% chance for Rnd[11] decrease in accuracy, 50% chance for Rnd[11] increase in accuracy,
	Purgat: -85, +Rnd[116],
	Doom:   -185, +Rnd[221],
	Note: Upper limit is higher by 20 points on Purgatory and by 25 points on Doom. This will result in archer accuracy raising when you approach them,
	Note: Previously, distance penalty for archers' ToHit was not compensated. Now it is, but randomly. Should give them ~10 to accuracy when close,
	Note: In other words, on average, archer chances to hit you will raise when you come closer to them. But it too depends on your AC in the end;
+	Relict prices revised;
+	Increased Fury duration effect now prolongs it by 150% (used to be 100%);
+	Fixed increased fury duration bug when host player's IFD effect affected all other players in game;
+	Holy Bolt damage formula revised: curMAG + 5 + Rnd[11], 200% damage for Purgatory, 300% - for Doom,
	Example: on Horror mode, if your character has current Magic of 60, Holy Bolt will deal [65-75] damage (60+5, +random (0 to 10) ),
	Example: on Purgatory, with curMAG of 100, it will do [210-230], on Doom, with cMAG of 300, it will do [915-945] Holy damage;
+	Fury effects now vary for character class:
	Paladin:	+clvl/2 accuracy, +clvl/2 AC, +clvl*2 base damage, -2 slvl, +clvl/4 DFE,
	Scout:		+clvl accuracy, -clvl AC, +clvl*2 base damage, -clvl/4 DFE,
	Mage:		+2 slvl, +clvl*2 maxCurMana, -clvl/2 AC, +clvl/4 DFE,
	Monk:		-clvl/2 accuracy, -1 slvl, +clvl*2 base damage, -clvl/4 DFE, +clvl/4 all resists,
	Assassin:	+clvl/2 AC, +clvl*2 base damage, +clvl/4 DFE, +clvl/4 all resists,
	Gladiator:	+clvl/2 accuracy, -clvl slvl, +4*clvl base damage, -clvl/2 AC, -clvl/2 DFE,
	Note: When under Fury, Gladiator becomes unable to cast any spells except his skill Aegis,
	Note: DFE cannot go lower than Vitality/difficulty-based limit allows,
	Note: Fury cannot be casted if current HPs are below CLVL value (for ex., with current HPs of 33 and clvl of 34);
+	Since Fury no longer boosts character Vitality, compensating life losses by correcting life gains from baseVIT. New life calculation formula:
	Paladin:  	3*Vitcharacter   + 2.5*Vititems + 2*clvl + Lifeitems + 18,
	Scout:  	1.5*Vitcharacter + 1.5*Vititems + 2*clvl + Lifeitems + 18,
	Mage:	 	1*Vitcharacter   + 1*Vititems   + 1*clvl + Lifeitems + 9,
	Monk:  		2.5*Vitcharacter + 2.5*Vititems + 2*clvl + Lifeitems + 18,
	Assassin:	2*Vitcharacter   + 2.5*Vititems + 2*clvl + Lifeitems + 18,
	Gladiator:  	3.5*Vitcharacter + 3*Vititems   + 2*clvl + Lifeitems + 11,
	Note: No, this formula will not make characters arrive at the exactly same values as characters would have under Fury,
	Note: This formula creates something that, in my opinion, is better for class balance;
+	Character base life formula updated to comply with HP changes above,
	Note: Now baseVIT gives correct amount of HPs, which need not be altered by MFA formula anymore;
+	Maximum chance to block in MvP Melee reduced: 80% >> 75%;
+	[Desert Dragon]: monsterslot limit raised to 400;
+	Re-activated monsters 201-203, and their bosses;
+	Starting character life adjusted to match with the new formula in MFA: Pal 80, Scout 50, Mage 25, Monk 70, Assassin 60, Gladiator 100;
+	Starting character mana adjusted to match with the new formula in MFA: Pal 5, Scout 12, Mage 60, Monk 12, Assassin 20, Gladiator 0;
+	Removed life substractions in Fury's leathargy phase to prevent player regeneration start after its end when they're dead;
+	Again, revised some unique item stats;
+	Again, revised some affix stats;
+	Fixed a bug with halfassed life substraction when changing dlvl under Fury,
	Note: A lot of current life was substracted, but restored when you click something in inventory. Now the substraction is just cancelled,
	Note: No life is modified now when you change dlvl, just Fury effects are dumped,
	Note: An so, Fury spell has been finally re-written, de-bugged and re-balanced. We're getting closer to perfection here... ;
+	Doom Archer renamed to Frozen Horror;
+	Corrected level transaction information in Abyss and Crypt (used to say "up/down to crypt/abyss level #" changed to "up/down to level #");
+	Added one more unique on uID#28,
	Note: By the way, when I mention uniques added on a uID, you'd better refresh your uniques on these items, might morph into something useful,
	Note: Refresh uniques by taking them from Stash to your player inventory and then start new game with the item in inventory,
	Note: Those that are subject to changes, will have updated data/stats and possibly morph into a different unique item;
+	Changed image for Light bow;
+	PvM Melee, new changes:
	Minimum chance tohit is now 5%, maximum - 95% (against bosses - 80%),
	Chances to hit a boss are lowered by [0-20]%,
	Armor Piercing is stackable (as before, just know that it can have a value of, for example, AP-5 is you have AP-2 on one item and AP 3 on another),
	Armor Piercing reduces initial monster AC by a certain percentage:
		Armor Piercing 1:	-6,25% AC 	(-12,5% AC for Gladiator),
		Armor Piercing 2:	-12,5% AC 	(-18,75% AC for Gladiator),
		Armor Piercing 3:	-18,75% AC 	(-25% AC for Gladiator),
		Armor Piercing 4:	-25% AC 	(-31,25% AC for Gladiator),
		Armor Piercing 5:	-31,25% AC 	(-37,5% AC for Gladiator),
		Armor Piercing 6:	-37,5% AC 	(-43,75% AC for Gladiator),
		Armor Piercing 7:	-43,75% AC 	(-50% AC for Gladiator),
		etc., also note that the higher monster AC is, the more useful Armor Piercing becomes due to reducing percentages and not static values,
	Monster AC is modified this way: (mAC+8) - Rnd[(mAC+8)/4]. In other words, roughly [75-100]%. Just a randomize;
+	Armor Piercing on magic items made stronger and randomized. Magic item AP potential is now higher than any among unique items:
	Piercing:	1-2,
	Puncturing:	2-3,
	Bashing:	3-4;
+	PvM Missile changes:
	Minimum chance to hit is raised: 1% >> 5%,
	Maximum chance to hit is 95% (against bosses - 80%),
	Final ToHit formula changed to:
		Horror:		30 + CLVL + ClassBonus + ToHit_items + curDEX - ((distance*distance)/2) - monsterAC,
		Purgatory:	30 + CLVL + ClassBonus + ToHit_items + curDEX - ((distance*distance)/2) - monsterAC + Rnd[51],
		Doom:		30 + CLVL + ClassBonus + ToHit_items + curDEX - ((distance*distance)/2) - monsterAC + Rnd[101],
		Note: On all difficulty modes, additional Rnd[21] ToHit chance decrease is applied if attacking a unique monster,
+	Minor updates in ReadMe files (except .htm's);
+	Added 4 more uniques on uID#22;
+	Corrected some info in base item data excel table ( http://thehellmod.ucoz.ru/Downloads/_BASEITEMLIST.xls );
+	Added quite a lot of unique items on different uID's. Tons of small adjustments to existing uniques,
	Note: There was so much done that I don't feel like documenting this all. Suffice to say, all classes are supplied with top level uniques now;
+	Revised TO DO list below;
+	Sneezed and yawned. Heh, OK, just kidding. I just yawned. Who would yawn after sneezing anyway? LOL,
	Note: I'm not sorry for wasting your time for reading the line above. LOL;
+	KB resistances in Singleplayer modified drastically to releive Scouts from burden of inability of knocking back dangerous monsters,
	Monsters that resist 33% of KB in SP are: all slow golem types, grave diggers, zombies and winged goats;
+	New color fixing pack (for Win7) from CableCat added to mod pack. Old files for colorfixes are removed;
+	[Desert Dragon]: monsterslot limit patch fixed (caused gamecrash on killing Uber on SP Horror, where movie has to start);
+	Added and applied lots of new pics for items from LeGioN;
+	Again, updated documentation;
+	Small code optimizations here and there;
+	Again, some fine tunings in base- and unique item data;

	Horror: - 10,  +Rnd[21],
	Purgat: - 75,  +Rnd[106],
	Doom:   - 160, +Rnd[201];
+	Melee attacks vs monster CBh will have maximum 40% chance to hit in multiplayer mode;
+	Monster CBh given resistance to melee damage from players:
	SP: 37%,
	MP: 50%;
+	Monster CBh is given dual attack: first atack comes on frame 8, second - on frame 9. Secondary attack also has +10% to its accuracy;

	Purgatory access:	characters of level 25 through 44,
	Doom access:		characters of level 40 and above;
+	Introducing Multiplayer Dynamic Difficulty (MDD). Now, monsters will resist damage from players, depending on how many players there are in a game:
	1 player:		0%,
	2 players:	25%,
	3 players:	37,5%,
	4 players:	50%;
+	Shared XP is activated again;
+	Shared XP now received randomly: (CLVL)% chance to receive shared XP if the source of potential XP is in friendly mode,
	Note: this (combined with MDD) should effectively prevent low level characters from leeching XP from others and skipping natural skill development,
	Note: high level players who love shared XP feature will still have a lot of Shared XP between them, up to maximum of 50% chance at CLVL 50,
	Note: in other words, the higher your level - the more XP you get in friendly co-op;

+	Removed Win7colorfix.zip archive from mod archive, replaced with Desert Dragon's .REG file fix ( Win7_Color_Fix.reg ), run this file if you're on Window 7 and see messed colors ingame;
	Note: once you have applied this .reg file, you should no longer see messed colors, even if you upgrade your version of The Hell mod;
	Note 2: the executable is the same, so it will not state that it's 1.126m revision #2;


	v1.126p, (23:16 11.06.2012), Full Release

+	Mask of Palantir revised;
+	Modified "Wise Drops": still works only in Singleplayer mode, monsters now can't drop items with requirements above player's current stats+10, bosses have +15 to such stat limitation,
	Note: if a character, for example, has 30 current Strength, monsters will be able to drop items that require up to 40 strength (bosses - up to 45);


	v1.126q, (17:30 25.06.2012), Patch

+	Uber Diablo special lightning damage (MP Doom mode) changed from 480 to 340;


	v1.126r, (15:02 01.07.2012), Patch

+	Uber Diablo drops revised:
	Single player, number of items dropped:
	Horror: none (end game, cinematic...),
	Purgatory: 3,
	Doom: 10,
	Multiplayer:
	Horror: 2,
	Purgatory: 3,
	Doom: 10;

+	Changing base monsters' XP rewards:
	Purg [ ( Horror + 400 ) * 2 ],

+	Pinky does less damage;
+	Modified uniques: Underworld Curse, Ice Shank;
+	Sleep timer increased to produce more frames per second, now the game runs at ~50fps (if you're still running on Pentium 200 MHz, this might slow you down heh);
+	Life regeneration formula changed: now for each 8 curVIT points, 1/64 HP is restored each frame. Gladiator class starts with +1 bonus;
+	Game pace lowered by ~16%, IMO it feels better that way;
+	Critical hit formula for Paladin class in PvM Melee modified from [CLVL/2]% for 250% damage to [(CLVL/4)+12]% for 300%, this shifts the tides for Paladins in favor of young characters, yet experienced ones will arrive at relatively same damage values in the end;
+	Paladins deal +25% bonus damage to Undead with sharp/blunt weapons (that's a class-specific feature of Paladins now);


	v1.127a, (15:55 24.07.2012), Patch

+	Game pace returned to default value ( have a look how it runs at 250% speed here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQclhGXysfo );
	by the way, watch the movie about Blizzard that I made: http://www.moddb.com/mods/diablo-the-hell/videos/diablo-3-players-quit-in-masses

+	Game FPS set to ~33;
+	"Wise Drops" revised: regular monsters and bosses can't go higher than ( character_base_stat_value + 10 + [CLVL/2] ) ,
	Note: this also means that switching your gear will no longer modify drops;

	v1.128a, (1:42 06.08.2012), Patch

	v1.130 beta 1, (14:55 31.08.2012), Full Release

	WARNING!!!
	MINOR AFFIX MORPHING POSSIBLE WITH THIS UPDATE
	(MOSTLY ON WEAPONS, BOWS, STAVES)

	This release was created with Yarik's help. We worked hard, and a lot. We hope you like it.
	And now go give those monsters some HELL! }:-)>

+	Character death animation no longer forced to play light armor + no weapon set, instead armor type is kept now;
+	Game forced CPU delays reduced from 30 to 15 (this somehow removes FPS drops in crypts);
+	[Yarik]: Satyr Lords used to cast only one Charged bolt, now fixed. They cast 6 bolts per attack now;
+	Player melee atack speed modifiers fixed:
	quick attack skips 1 frame,
	fast attack skips 2 frames,
	faster skips 2,5 frames,
	fastest skips 3 frames,
	anyway, this is how attack speeds should have been but got never fixed by Blizzard;
+	Attack speed modifiers also don't stack and don't interfere with each other - always the best is used;
+	Suffix of Piercing set to value 2;
+	Suffix of Bashing is given attack speed increase effect and set to value 3 (faster attack) and Renamed to Haste;
+	Suffix of Puncturing renamed to Bashing and set to value 3;
+	Suffix of Speed renamed to Alacrity;
+	Suffix of Haste renamed to Speed;
+	All unique item speedups reduced by 1 (faster >> fast, fast >> quick) for compensation of attack speed fixes;
+	Bow attack speed modifying code rewritten, optimized and balanced:
	quick attack: +1 speed,
	fast: +1,5 speed,
	faster: +2 speed,
	fastest: +3 speed;
+	Some unique items revised;
+	[Yarik]: Selling items at Griswold now displays correct colors in all menus (e.g., golds no longer turn blue in confirmation menus);
+	Resurrection with items that reduce life no longer results in dead respawn in town;
+	Spellbooks are no longer readable when maximum Spell level is reached (max base SLVL = 15);
+	Added CLVL requirement for books. It works that way: a book's SLVL should be (CLVL/4)+3 or lower to be readable;
+	Added VIT requirement on items; << fix item's unchecking unless touched
+	Revised " +Vitality " affix series;
+	Crypts are allowed to generate room types:
	shrine room,
	library,
	explosive urn room,
	treasury,
	magic item room,
	burning cross room,
	room with decapitated bodies;
+	Crypt libraries are given more fitting book stands and case/shelf analogues;
+	Crypt shrines are given new image (could use some polishment though);
+	Shrine availability through dungeon levels was revised (including Crypt now in many cases);
+	Assigned VIT requirements to all base items (of course, not all base items have it, but all base items are revised);
+	All unique items reivsed;
+	Quest levels now forbid casting TP, leaving or saving game until area is cleared from monsters (special sound will be heard when a quest level is cleared);
+	Town portal colors changed to my liking;
+	Monsters can no longer knock back a player out of his/her light radius ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HARq2CE_49A );
+	Drops from dungeon objects are taken under control by capping their base with the formula that limits (in addition to QLVL checks) maximum attributes required:
	Horror:		(DLVL*4)+44,
	Purgatory:	(DLVL*4)+144,
	Doom:		no cap, plus no QLVL check,
	Note: this should stop too powerful items from dropping too early, and prevent some powerful items from being withheld on Doom. And AFAIK, it does not affect racks and armor stands;
+	Monk: attack frame for bow & axe set to 14;
+	Golem AC formula set to: ((slvl+10)*4)-30;
+	Golem made selectible;
+	Golem shows stats now;
+	Monk unarmed (kick) damage formula set to: ((CLVL*(curSTR+curDEX))/60)+5;
+	Monk is now much more skilled with bows: attacks faster (frames 9, 10, 11 & 12 are cut off). This should now make him able to utilize bows in fight with ranged attackers. This update is of course compatible with the attack modifiers;
-	Lazarus SP cinematic made skippable;
+	Monk is faster with axe now, the speed is similar to that of his staff (frames [8-12] cut off). This should leave him with trinity of weapons of choice: staff, axe & bow;
+	Monk now can score criticals when using bows. The formula is {(CLVL/4)+3}% chance for doubling the total damage, if the check is successful, the chance % is reduced by 1, and if it's not below 2, the check is made again by re-rolling,
	for instance, if Monk level is 40 (and he's using a bow, and processed damage to do is, let's say, 100), his first check for critical is (40/4)+3 of 100 (which is 13%), if the check is successful, the damage is doubled (200 now), the chance is reduced by 1 (12% now) and re-rolled,
	if it's successful again, the damage is doubled again (400 now), the chance is further reduced by 1 (11% now), and so on.. if the chance reaches 1 after a successful hit, no further checks will be made. So, the chance for critical will be made again and again until it fails or the chance gets too low;
+	Leoric's Tomb on Horror mode populated with strong skeletons at start to indicate at once that it's an Uber level;
+	Formula of randomized missile magic damage in MvP changed from ( Rnd [ resist + 5 ] + 10 ) % to [ { ( Resist / 2 ) + 1 } + { (Rnd [ Resist / 2 ] ) + 1 } ] %. This should finally solve the issue of some characters getting stunned or damaged hard too often from magic shooters;
+	Golem was immune (!) to all types of ranged damage from monsters (it is unthinkable that none of you reported that);
+	All monster non-melee AI's will target Golem(s) now instead of players IF Golem(s) is/are closer to them. This, on one hand, will make Golem(s) better tanks, attracting all the fire, and, on the other hand, will make them melt faster;
+	Spells 'Flame Ring' and 'Lightning Ring' now display damage stats in spellbook;
+	In multiplayer coop games, bosses will drop number of items that is equal to number of players that attacked them minus 1, plus old specific bonus to drops (we weren't able to test that ourselves, so please report the results to me),
	for instance, if a boss used to drop 3 items before, and it's attacked by 2 players now, he'll drop +1 item (4 total)
+	TH.exe is given new icon;
+	Heal Other manacost revised: 8 + (2*clvl) - (3*slvl),
	Conditions: if lower than 1/8 of maxCurMana, set to maxCurMana/8; if higher than 1/4 maxCurMana, seto maxCurMana/4. Final manacost can't be below 40 (can be reduced to 30 by wearing an item 'of Profit');
+	Golem gets destroyed if its master is killed;
	My video on the subject:

+	Introducing new feature: "Chain Activation". It effectively makes alerted monsters activate the monsters nearby. Works for monsters that see a player (entered by a player's light radius, and if within line of sight), or are damaged by a missile;
+	Assassin starting hammer: image update;
+	Cave Boar renamed to Umber Hulk;


	v1.130 beta 3, (13:52 06.09.2012), Full Release

+	Left-clicking Golem now doesn't make player characters attack it;
+	After Horror mode, Fallen no longer retreat when a nearby monster is killed;

	arrows: -75% damage,
	resisted spells: -93,75% damage,
	non-resisted (physical) spells: -75%,
	Note: it's made for summoned Golem more adequate damage resistance, but should circumstances call for MvM battles, Golem monsterslot check will be required (along with DR rebalancing);

+	Quest area-specific spell restrictions are now processed as they should, with inability to be cast, instead of being terminated during the actual casting;
+	'Diablo' quest is now cleared from the questbook after Diablo is killed;
+	[Yar] Fixed the bug with undying monsters that are killed by Mage class with MS and Reflect while having few HPs, a rare but nasty bug;
+	Scythe Goats now cast less charged bolts per attack: 6 >> 4;
+	Fixed quest selection and  randomization routine;
+	Created the biggest quest so far: Horazon's Demons (I could write hundreds of lines describing it, but I'll limit it to just one);


	v1.144, (1:16 24.12.2012), Patch // cancelled because drop system ended up in bugs


	v1.144d, (15:31 27.12.2012), Patch

+	Item information is now updated each 5 seconds automatically. This means that you don't have to restart game to update item data. And it means that as soon as you take items out of stash, they will immediately morph into what they are meant to be,
	Note: this makes some shrines that modify item damage and AC obsolete (will modify these shrines, too);
+	Corrupt Paladin attack speed decreased: 11 >> 14;
+	MvP Melee autohit values revised:
	Paladin: 20%,
	Scout: 20%,
	Mage: 30%,
	Monk: 18%,
	Assassin: 12%,
	Gladiator: 21%;
+	[Yar] Monster and boss drops finally been made take difficulty mode into action;
+	Revised all affixes of DFE, +damage and +stat series;
+	Rewritten magic item drop code, so that it doesn't morph existing items (unless they were obtained through inhonest methods),
	Note: whereas unique item drop rules are unchanged, blue item generation (from monsters) has been considerably altered,
	Note: the formulas is ( (MLVL / 3) + (Diff * 20) + 3 ), where Diff is 0 for Horror, 1 for Purgatory and 2 for Doom. Boss monsters receive +4 bonus on top of the formula,
	Note: minimum is capped at 25 as maximum (which is by default, since original's times), and the upper - at 63,
	Note: the following table displays what affix quality ranges are available now, according to MLVL and difficulty mode (bosses in brackets): http://www.thehellmod.ucoz.ru/Pix/Other/aff.jpg
+	Death animation of characters fixed: now shown (was broken in 1.144);
+	Started adding support for set synergy;


	v1.145, (22:59 29.12.2012), Patch

+	Revised values and prices for prefixes of '+X% damage' series;
+	Support for set synergy is ready;
+	Added bonus features for existing sets;


	v1.146, (18:29 08.01.2013), Full Release

+	Wirt prices now are 150% of Griswold's prices (instead of 75%);
+	Relicts of Healing/Mana now auto-placed on belt when buying from Adria or Pepin or picking up from the floor;
+	Warp is selectable in speedbook;
+	Blocking while under Reflect spell now functions exactly as without shield (or blocking), reducing melee damage absorption by 50% and giving monsters 400% of that unresisted damage back (200% to bosses);
+	ARD damage reduction was flawed for some spells (inferno, lightning, flash, firewall, lightning wall, acid puddles): now it's fixed. Also, DFE gives more noticeable protection against these now;
+	Pinky moved to dlvl-6, and is placed in a closed big room. So, now this uberboss is made optional. You can avoid fighting him if you wish. But if you do want this challenge, you can enter that room and have this fight,
	Note: here is the demonstration - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLoZoVLKsKY
+	Walk / Jog option is saved in SP savegame file now, and thus depends on individual savegame setting rather than for a game as a whole. It also doesn't get reset to walking after restarting the game;
+	Saving game while under buff spells (Fury, Reflect, Etherealize) and then loading game doesn't clear active effects from the player (this surely solves the Fury's actively unerased timer and deactivated effect that used to be carried over to a load game);
+	Adria shop items are now sorted properly: forced items > relicts > staves > books > runes ;
+	Uber Xorene moved to dlvl-22's closed room (Cornerstone type);
+	Ceromorth moved to closed room, too;
+	MDD values revised (both MvP Melee & Missile):
	1 player:		0%,
	2 players:	25%,
	3 players:	37,5%,
	4 players:	50%;
+	Potions of Healing/Mana/Holy water and Relicts of Healing/Mana now can be Shift+LClicked to belt. Shift+LClicking belt items also will move them to the furthest free left belt slot;
+	Celia is muted to prevent her from speaking in demonic voices;


	v1.147, (20:45 13.01.2013), Patch

+	Fixed Uber Xorene's AI flaw;
+	Increased armor piercing on blue items;
+	Armor piercing is now displayed correctly, showing correct values;
+	Autoclicker integrated into the game. You now need to stop using 3rd party autocliker software,
	Note: ingame clicker works when you keep Left or Right mouse button pressed while holding Shift,
	Note: certainly, autoclicking allows to stop clicking, but it effectively reduces attack/cast speed by 0,1 sec, so you have to choose (again): a little slower autoclicking or fullspeed manual clicking *grin* ;
+	Dark Ghosts no longer cast Necromorb stars on 2nd and 3rd difficulty modes;


	v1.148, (17:33 18.01.2013), Patch

	max =  (DLVL*8)+155,
	  Doom:
	min = (DLVL*5)+345,
	max = (DLVL*8)+345;
+	Autocliker delay set to zero;
+	Fire(and Lightning) Arrow trap damage formula revised (elemental damage part):
	Horr:
	min: Rnd[Dlvl*2]+(Dlvl*4)+1,
	max: Rnd[Dlvl*4]+(Dlvl*4)+25,
	Purg: 
	min: Rnd[Dlvl*4]+(Dlvl*8)+50,
	max: Rnd[Dlvl*8]+(Dlvl*8)+110,
	Doom: 
	min: Rnd[Dlvl*8]+(Dlvl*8)+120,
	max: Rnd[Dlvl*16]+(Dlvl*16)+250;
+	The following trap types are allowed to appear in Crypt: mana_sucking, potion_breaking, fire_arrow;
+	Lachdanan no longer drops magic items when dying;


	v1.149, (22:28 21.01.2013), Full Release

+	Added 1 more palette type to Cathedral (total 87 now);

+	Fixed a bug that caused Hell music play in MP Catacombs;
+	Fixed Necromorb AI missile type (was broken);


	v1.149m, (23:50 01.02.2013), Patch

+	Monsters no longer leave shadows in coop if killed by more than one player;
+	Monster multidrop (duped) in coop fixed (hopefully);
+	Death tolls are now shown in values;
+	Character passive melee damage resistance modified to:
	Gladiator: [ 20 + ( Rnd[baseVIT/8] + 36) ]%,
	Paladin: [ 15 + ( Rnd[baseVIT/8] + 36) ]%,
	Monk: [ 13 + (CLVL/16) + ( Rnd[baseVIT/8] + 36) ]%;
+	Cain's dialogue menu is given color support for unique and set items;
+	An attempt made [by Yarik] to fix hit sounds in PvP Ranged (magic). Not sure how it worked out;
+	A weird rune functionality programmatic fix [by Yarik] that should prevent potential memory corruption (yeah, there's little that I understand about it, too);


	v1.149n, (13:25 04.02.2013), Patch

+	Removed 'Increased Fury duration' check from PvM Ranged to prevent it from interfering with Gargoyle stoning state (this _probably_ resulted in their squatting sometimes);


	v1.149p, (16:32 11.02.2013), Patch

+	Fixed a bug that allowed lifestealing in PvP through utilizing ILS items;
+	[Desert Dragon]: added support for Windows 8,
	Note: under Windows 8, set TH.exe file settings to "run in Win98 compatibility mode" and "use 640x480 resolution",
	Note: if you're running Win8, try with these file settings and without them, to test it, and report to me. I'd like to know how it works (I can't test myslef because of running Win7);


	v1.149q, (21:04 12.02.2013), Patch

+	Minor town sector 1 architecture adjustments and fixes;
+	[Desert Dragon]: win8 support fixed,
	Note: under Windows 8, set TH.exe file settings to "run in Win95 compatibility mode" and "use 640x480 resolution",

+	Dregbez room has 2x more doors now, Pinky/Ceromorth - 1,5x more;
+	Combination of sharp + blunt produced no effect of increased damage vs undead/demons with these effects active on player, now fixed,
	Note: mixed style dual wielders will benefit from this;

	Paldn:	10+(CLVL/4)% for 250% dmg,

+	Additional check added to monster stun formula. Excluding stun-immune monsters, damaging a monster for { ( ( monster_baseHP * 1,5 ) + monster_currentHP ) / 8 } of its maximum life (or stronger) stuns it now,
	Note: this requires damaging monster for 31% of its maximum HP when its current HP is at its full, and damaging it for about 21% when its current HP is at 22%,
	Note: in other words, to stun a monster that has 1000 of 1000 HP, you need to deal 310 damage, and to stun it when it has 220 of 1000 HP will take "only" 210 damage,
	Note: minimum is 18%, but you won't see that as it will kill the monster anyway ^_^,
	Note: yes, it does make killing monsters more pleasant, and yes, it does make the game a little easier;
+	Readme files updated;
+	Hoop of Magma redesigned;

+	Prefix 'Rotting' now gives ILS and is renamed to 'Draining';
+	Prefix 'Crafted' now sets item durability to [200-250] instead of adding [101-200]% to its base durability (still, I'd like to replace it with something better);
+	There will no longer be scroll chunks scattered through Crypt levels 21-23 as this now is a part of 'Horazon's Demons' quest;
+	Fixed a bug that made Magic Rock morph into a mundane item (usually, mana potion) some 5 secondds after being picked up (or dropped from its table?);
+	Revised values for resist all prefix series, to make them more attractive early on;
+	Abyss levels will now have shrines (currently: cauldrons, when I'm in a mood for drawing some guts that might look like shrine, I'll do that): 0-1 on Horror, 0-2 on Purgatory and 0-3 on Doom;
