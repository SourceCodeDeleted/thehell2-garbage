The question that I keep asking myself is how he could have fallen so far from the Light, as Leoric had always been the holiest of men.

With each passing day, Leoric seemed to slip deeper into madness.  He sought to blame innocent townsfolk for the boy's disappearance and had them brutally executed.  Less than half of us survived his insanity...\n \nThe King's Knights and Priests tried to placate him, but he turned against them and sadly, they were forced to kill him.  With his dying breath the King called down a terrible curse upon his former followers.  He vowed that they would serve him in darkness forever...\n \nThis is where things take an even darker twist than I thought possible!  Our former King has risen from his eternal sleep and now commands a legion of undead minions within the Labyrinth.  His body was buried in a tomb three levels beneath the Cathedral.  Please, good master, put his soul at ease by destroying his now cursed form... |",	1,	5,	S_442 },

He is known to mortal men as Diablo.  It was he who was imprisoned within the Labyrinth many centuries ago and I fear that he seeks to once again sow chaos in the realm of mankind.
